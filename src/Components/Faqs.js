                        Pre-money valuation is the valuation of a company before it receives any new funding. It reflects how much the company is worth based on its assets, revenues, growth potential, and other factors before any new investment is made. The pre-money valuation is important because it helps determine how much equity the investors will receive in exchange for their investment. <br /><br />

                            <strong>Pre-seed:</strong> The earliest stage of funding, typically involving personal funds, friends, family, or angel investors. It's used to develop an idea into a business plan or build a minimum viable product (MVP).<br /><br />
                            
                            <strong>Seed:</strong> This stage involves raising capital to validate the product-market fit, build a team, and grow the business. Seed funding is often provided by angel investors or early-stage venture capital (VC) firms.<br /><br />
                            
                            <strong>Series A:</strong> At this stage, startups have a proven business model and are looking to scale. Series A funding is used to optimize the product, acquire more customers, and generate consistent revenue. It’s usually raised from venture capital firms.<br /><br />
                            
                            <strong>Series B:</strong> Startups at this stage are ready for major expansion, like growing the team, expanding to new markets, or significantly boosting revenue. Series B funding comes from VCs and sometimes late-stage investors.<br /><br />
                            
                            <strong>Series C:</strong> This stage is for companies that are already successful and are looking to expand further, either by launching new products, entering new markets, or acquiring other businesses. Series C funding often involves VCs, private equity firms, and hedge funds.<br /><br />
                            
                            <strong>Series D and beyond:</strong> Series D is less common and typically used for further expansion or to prepare the company for an IPO (Initial Public Offering) or a major acquisition. It may also occur if the company has not yet achieved the milestones needed for an IPO and needs additional funds to reach that goal.
